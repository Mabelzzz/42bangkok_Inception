# 1. Basic Settings
# The user that runs the MariaDB process
user                    = mysql
# Process ID file location
pid-file                = /run/mysqld/mysqld.pid
# Socket file for local connections (within the container)
socket                  = /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock
# TCP Port to listen on
port                    = 3306
# Base directory for installation
basedir                 = /usr
# Directory where the actual database files are stored (Volume mounted)

# Temporary directory

# Error log location

# 2. Networking (CRITICAL)
# Bind to 0.0.0.0 to allow connections from ANY IP address.
# If set to 127.0.0.1, only the container itself can connect (WordPress would fail).

# 3. Performance & Logs
# Query Cache (optional, but good for small setups)

# Location of the error log file
